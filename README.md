# robook

This marks our initial attempt at incorporating C#, WinForms, and the Rithmic API.

I acknowledge that my current implementation may not be the most optimal 
in terms of code structure for utilizing the Rithmic C# API to visualize 
order book data. 

Regrettably, due to a lack of energy, certain sections of the code remain 
unfinished or have been implemented in a superficial manner, 
apart from those areas that are already poorly executed.

To run the project you need rapiplus.dll ([rapiplus.dll](Library%2Frapiplus.dll)) 
and RApiConfig files ( [State.cs](Robook%2FState%2FState.cs)) which you can get by emailing Rithmic support.

For discussion and questions I created a [Discord](https://discord.gg/ua8PZFxz) server.
